**Observation 1:**
- Observe the rocking behaviour of the block and also the energy loss during each impact.
- User can also compare where the time period remains same under different amplitude conditions.
- The idea behind the specific floor animations is that as we go higher up, the motion of the block increases proportionally.
- The steps mentioned in the animations refers to the time steps.
