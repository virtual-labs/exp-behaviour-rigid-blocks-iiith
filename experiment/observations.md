Start the experiment with the default values of length, mass and intial displacement (in angle). Pause the experiment after few cycles and note the observation.

**Observation 1:** Rocking behavior of the rigid block to given displacement

Observe the rocking behaviour of the block and also the energy loss during each impact.
User can note the zero crossings of the displacement and calculate the time period.
User can also compare where the time period remains same under different amplitude conditions.
